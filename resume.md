## Anomaly Detection on Streamed Data
Welcome to the **Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection** project! This repository provides a framework for detecting anomalies in real-time data streams using the Z-score method. It includes data simulation, anomaly detection, and real-time visualization.
1.  **Continuous Data Stream Simulation**: A function generates synthetic data with seasonal variation, noise, and rare anomalies.
2.  **Z-Score Anomaly Detection**: Efficiently detects outliers based on the Z-score formula.
3.  **Real-time Visualization**: Continuously updates a plot to visualize the data stream and mark detected anomalies.
4.  **Interactive Plot**: Red markers indicate anomalies in the live-updating plot for easy identification.
5.  **Robust Error Handling and Data Validation**: Ensures that the data points are valid and checks for potential issues in processing. This keeps the algorithm stable and avoids crashes in production environments.
